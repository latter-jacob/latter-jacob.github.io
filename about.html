    I met my wife over 6 years ago at a mutual friends party in college.  Just as we met someone yelled that they were beginning a “photoshoot” with us as the subjects (alcohol may have been involved).  In an Austin Powers fashion they began yelling out emotions or poses for us to do.  I went in for a kiss when “you’re in love” got shouted.  I got turned down.  I was just really into the photoshoot not trying to be super forward I swear.  Anyway it is very cool to have a slew of pictures from the moment we first met.

    I love to travel.  I will say the biggest reason why is food.  I agreed to a San Francisco vacation thinking the whole time that I am to big a fan of manga not to have had real ramen before.  It was not a let down.  I’ve had the freshest fruit and coffee in Costa Rica, poutine in Montreal, lobster in Maine, crab cakes in D.C..  First thing I did when I got to Boston was grab some baked beans.  Sadly Columbia was a bust for food.  I was stuck with rich culture, welcoming people, and once in a lifetime views.  You can’t win them all :(

    Tech has always been a big part of my life.  I remember getting the first family computer.  I remember being a cool family that had a separate phone line for dial-up.  I’ve had just about every game system there was (other than SEGA, that doesn’t count).  I’ve always enjoyed pulling something new out of it’s box, reading all I can about it and then setting it up.
    <br><br>
    Although I’ve loved technology for a long time, I have always looked at coding as something I would have to dedicate 40 years, starting at my birth, to be able to do.  I took a c.s 100 class in college that seemed to go from the first half of the class explaining what the mysterious computer mouse was transitioning to the second half being high level java and binary.  This turned me off for a long time until a friend of mine told me to try codcademy after I was chatting about switching careers with him.  I found myself enthralled.  I was learning coding bit by bit decided to go to Launch Academy to further my knowledge.
    <br><br>
    My love of awesome, new or just better tech goes on.  My wish list grows as I delve farther into my career as a web developer.

  <div class="about-text">
    EMS is/was a huge portion of my life.  I say "was" because I worked 5 years at this career.  AKA 20% of my life or 100% of my working life.  I say "is" because it is not something you just turn off, at least not right now.  You do not stop walking into new places and glancing around to see if there are any threats to the “scene”, you don’t stop hyper-analysing every time someone is hurt or ill, and you don’t stop wanting to help people.  I learned great life long skills, with great and not so great memories that helped shape me through my early twenties.  I believe this career kept me grounded in a age bracket where it is hard to be.  I will miss pulling all nighters, charging into a house you’ve never been not knowing whats on the inside, having too dark a sense of humor, and never ever wanting to talk about my job.
